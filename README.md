# 🧠 Devtronic Hugo Theme

> _A sleek, modern Hugo theme inspired by the digital glow of the Matrix — elegant, legible, and engineered for developers who appreciate beauty in logic._

---

## ✨ Overview

**Devtronic** is a responsive, semantic Hugo theme designed for developer blogs, tech journals, and digital portfolios.  
It draws visual inspiration from terminal aesthetics — think **emerald phosphor glow**, **matte blacks**, and **precise typography** — but refined with subtle gradients, soft shadows, and accessible contrast.

Clean structure, thoughtful hierarchy, and performance-first CSS make it ideal for developers who want a _modern retro-futurist_ feel without the eyestrain of a pure neon palette.
